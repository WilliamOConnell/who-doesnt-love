# Who Doesn't Love Chili's?
Capital One [asked](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/d052bcf8-4580-4922-95ef-a9f6ceaf0f10) participants to make the process of picking a restauraunt easier. My solution is simple: Who Doesn't Love Chili's? Put your hand down, it's a rhetorical question.

The app searches Yelp for local restaurants, but only ones that are Chili's. This way you can be sure that you're going to a 3.5 star Chili's and not the 2.5 star one down the street where they always burn the tortilla chips.
